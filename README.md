# Checkpoint Inhibitor Hypothyroidism Risk Assessment System

A web-based application for personalized dosing recommendations of checkpoint inhibitors based on hypothyroidism risk assessment using Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) modeling.

## üî¨ Overview

This application provides evidence-based dosing recommendations for checkpoint inhibitor therapy by assessing individual patient risk factors for developing hypothyroidism. The system uses QSP modeling to calculate personalized risk scores and provide tailored dosing strategies.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Patient Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation based on:
  - Demographics (age, sex, weight)
  - TPO antibody status
  - Performance status
  - Autoimmune disease history
  
- **Multi-Drug Support**: Dosing recommendations for:
  - Nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor)
  - Pembrolizumab (PD-1 inhibitor)
  - Atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor)
  - Durvalumab (PD-L1 inhibitor)

- **Personalized Recommendations**: 
  - Risk-stratified dosing adjustments
  - Monitoring frequency recommendations
  - Visual risk assessment dashboard

- **Interactive Interface**: 
  - Real-time risk calculation
  - Responsive design for various devices
  - Intuitive patient data entry

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

2. **Select Checkpoint Inhibitor**:
   - Choose from available drugs
   - View drug-specific parameters

3. **View Risk Assessment**:
   - Real-time risk score calculation
   - Color-coded risk stratification
   - Personalized dosing recommendations

4. **Monitor Recommendations**:
   - Suggested monitoring frequency
   - Dose adjustment guidelines
   - Clinical considerations

## üß™ Scientific Background

### QSP Modeling Approach

The application implements a QSP model that incorporates:

- **Pharmacokinetic Parameters**: Drug clearance, volume of distribution
- **Pharmacodynamic Factors**: Receptor binding affinity (Kd), potency
- **Patient-Specific Factors**: Age, sex, autoimmune status
- **Biomarker Integration**: TPO antibody levels

### Risk Stratification

**Low Risk (Green)**: 
- Risk score < 1.5
- Standard dosing recommended
- Monitoring every 6-8 weeks

**Moderate Risk (Yellow)**: 
- Risk score 1.5-2.5
- 25% dose reduction or extended intervals
- Monitoring every 4 weeks

**High Risk (Red)**: 
- Risk score > 2.5
- 50% dose reduction or alternative agent
- Monitoring every 2 weeks initially

## üìä Supported Checkpoint Inhibitors

| Drug | Target | Standard Dose | Susceptibility Rate |
|------|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Nivolumab | PD-1 | 3 mg/kg | 25% |
| Pembrolizumab | PD-1 | 2 mg/kg | 30% |
| Atezolizumab | PD-L1 | 15 mg/kg | 20% |
| Durvalumab | PD-L1 | 10 mg/kg | 18% |
